# deno_lib

Fully-featured and extensible Deno crate for embedding Deno in your Rust app (unofficial).

This is a fork of the [Deno project](https://github.com/denoland/deno), but with the goal of making it easier to embed Deno in a Rust application. The fork is made in a way that it should be easy to merge the changes from the Deno project.
